# Hailey’s Hotel – Unit 1 (User-Centric Front-End Dev)

Prototype UI for Hailey’s Hotel online booking system, produced for the Level 5 Diploma (Gateway Quals • Unit 1).  
The goal is to modernise the current paper-based process by giving guests and staff a fast, accessible front-end.

## Core user stories
* *Guest (new)* – browse rooms and book without phoning reception.  
* *Guest (returning)* – log in to view / amend past and current bookings.  
* *Receptionist* – search availability quickly, add reservations, apply loyalty discounts.

## Accessibility & UX pledges
* WCAG-AA colour contrast and keyboard-only navigation.  
* Semantic HTML; ARIA labels only where semantics fall short.  
* Forms & pop-ups give instant feedback and always keep focus trapped.

## Tech stack
HTML5 • CSS (Grid + Flexbox) • vanilla JS (minimal, only for interactions)  
Version control with **Git/GitHub** (commit per feature) • Deployed via **GitHub Pages**.
